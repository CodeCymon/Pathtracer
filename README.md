# Based on the Walnut App Template

This is a simple app template for [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) - unlike the example within the Walnut repository, this keeps Walnut as an external submodule and is much more sensible for actually building applications. See the [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) repository for more details.

# Basic Info

This repository uses the walnut template and tries to eventually implement a GPU Pathtracer. 
It is mostly a learning project for understanding lighttransport and diving into C++ and eventually also the Vulkan API.
